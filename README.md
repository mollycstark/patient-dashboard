# ü©∫ Patient Dashboard (Finni Take-Home)

A simple full-stack CRUD app for managing patient records. Built with **React (Vite + TypeScript)** on the frontend and **Flask + SQLite (via SQLAlchemy)** on the backend.

## üöÄ Running the App

üîß Development Mode

Run frontend and backend separately (recommended for live pairing / fast dev):

---

### 1. **Start Flask backend**

```bash
cd patient-dashboard
```

If Python 3.11 is available globally:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

If you're using Homebrew on macOS:

```bash
/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.11/bin/python3.11 -m venv venv
```

Then activate the environment and install dependencies:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

---

### 2. **Start React frontend**

In a new terminal tab:

```bash
cd patient-dashboard/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies API requests to the Flask backend at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### ‚úÖ Implemented

- Added login/signup for providers using email and password
  - Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- Each provider sees only their own patients
- Name fields (first, middle, last) are stored separately
  - Middle name is optional
  - Auto-capitalized and trimmed for consistency
  - Character limits enforced at the database level (50 characters each)
  - Future versions should prevent duplicate patient entries
- Status is limited to 4 predefined values: Inquiry, Onboarding, Active, Churned
- DOB is required, uses a date picker, and must not be in the future
- Address is stored as a flat string
  - UI includes a format hint: "123 Main St, San Francisco, CA 94110"
  - Future versions may split this into structured fields
- SQLAlchemy + SQLite used for persistent backend storage
- React (Vite + TypeScript) communicates with Flask via proxied REST API
- MUI used for layout and form components
  - Provides built-in validation and accessibility support
- Patient data persists across refreshes via database
- Flask backend is structured to support lightweight unit tests (e.g. using `pytest` or Flask‚Äôs built-in test client)

---

### ‚ùì Questions

- Should address fields be broken into city/state/zip in the DB?
- Should patient records be editable/deletable?
- Should providers be able to filter/search by status or DOB?
- Should the table be sortable by columns (e.g. last name, DOB)?
- Should providers be able to click into a detailed view of a patient?
